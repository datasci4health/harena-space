# Templates

Templates are organized in template families or family sets. Each family has a subdirectory and they are exclusive alternatives, i.e., only one template family can be used in each translation.
The families currently available are:

* **classic** - Minimal template without extra format.

* **jacinto** - Standard template for Jacinto cases.

Each template family has a HTML file for each available knot category. There is always a dafault `knot.html` template used for those knots that do not specify a category, or those that specify unknown categories.
